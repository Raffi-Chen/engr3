# CircuitPython
This repository will actually serve as an aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.  If you want to draw inspiration from other classmates, feel free to check [this directory of all students!](https://github.com/chssigma/Class_Accounts).

## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```

**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**  

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.

And here is how you should give image credit to someone if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**



## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
# importing certian aspects to code
import time
import board # allow board to connect
import pwmio # pulse width modulation: allow servo to comm with board
import digitalio
from adafruit_motor import servo # imports servo

# initializes pulse width modulation and constraints concerning it on board
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# my_servo is initializes as servo variable
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

# define pins for each button
pin = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D1)
pin.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
pin.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP

button_state = False

pin2 = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D2)
pin2.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
pin2.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP

button_state2 = False


while True:
    pressed = pin.value
    # if left button pressed
    if pin.value:
        print("Left")
        for angle in range(0, 180, 5):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
            my_servo.angle = angle
            time.sleep(0.05)
    # if right button pressed
    if pin2.value:
        print("Right")
        for angle in range(180, 0, -5): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
            my_servo.angle = angle
            time.sleep(0.05)
    button_state = pressed
```

[This is the Servo reference code I used.](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-servo)

[Additionally, I referenced this code for the use of buttons.](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-with-circuitpython/buttons)


### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
Then post an image here.   [Here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
