This repository will actually serve as an aid to help you get started with your own template.  You should copy the raw form of this readme into your own, and use this template to write your own.  If you want to draw inspiration from other classmates, feel free to check [this directory of all students!](https://github.com/chssigma/Class_Accounts).

## Hello_CircuitPython <!---->

### Description & Code Snippets
Write a couple sentences here, describing this assignment, and make sure that you hit these two points:
* What was the goal of the assignment?
* How did you accomplish that goal?
  How you accomplished the goal is NOT a reflection, it is you telling the reader how to do this assignment, in broad strokes.

  Your description is the right place to draw the reader's attention to any important chunks of code. Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here

```

**Lastly, please end this section with a link to your code or file.**  

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your finished work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does.
For making a GIF, I recommend [ezgif.com](https://www.ezgif.com) Remember you can insert pictures using Markdown or HTML to insert an image.

And here is how you should give image credit to someone if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your Google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
Don't just tell the reader what went wrong or was challenging!  Describe how you figured it out, share the things that helped you succeed (tutorials, other people's repos, etc.), and then share what you learned from that experience.  **Your underlying goal for the reflection, is to concisely pass on the RIGHT knowledge that will help the reader recreate this assignment better or more easily.  Pass on your wisdom!**

## CircuitPython_Servo <!---->

### Description & Code Snippets
The goal of this asignment was to use two buttons to control the direction of a servo. This was the more significant initial endeavor into CircuitPython, as the code was not provided up front. I used code libraries provided by the examples folder we downloaded earlier this year, as well as internet examples, to help.


Using a button requires a lot more than Arduino did

```python
import digitalio

# define pins for each button
pin = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D1)
pin.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
pin.pull = digitalio.Pull.UP

button_state = False

while True:
    # if left button pressed
    if pin.value:
        print("Left")
```
Servo code is very similar to arduino, and not worth mentioning here.   If you want to see servo code, just click my code link below:

### Wiring

### Reflection
Although the wiring was easy due to the exact sameness to Arduino wiring, this assignment was difficult in terms of code due to my inexperience in CircuitPython. Initially, I attempted to copy it word for word from Arduino. I soon discovered that not all commands were the same as Arduino and couldn't be translated exactly, just as English can't be translated word for word to French. For example, you need to import the board to the code in CircuitPython, something that was implied in Arduino. However, I eventually found a few examples in the Adafruit CircuitPython library, and including <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-servo">this sketch</a> on servos on CircuitPython (where PWM needs to be integrated with a simple line of command that does all the work for you, and then for statements are needed to actually set servo values) and <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-with-circuitpython/buttons">this sketch</a> on buttons (where many of the functions are similar to Arduino but need colons instead of curly brackets, and need to be initiated with digitalio.)

### Wiring
[tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits).  If you can't find the particular part you need, get creative, and just drop a note into the circuit diagram, explaining.
For example, I use an Arduino Uno to represent my Circuitpython device but write a note saying which board I'm actually using.
Then post an image here.   [Here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
